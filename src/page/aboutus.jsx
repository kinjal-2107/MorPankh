          Welcome to <strong>MORPANKH</strong> — where tradition meets trend in
          men's fashion.
        </p>

        <p className="fs-5">
          At Morpankh, we believe that fashion is not just about clothing — it’s
          a reflection of identity. Our brand is inspired by the timeless
          elegance of the peacock feather (morpankh), symbolizing grace, pride,
          and bold expression.
        </p>

        <p className="fs-5">
          Founded with a passion for redefining men’s style, Morpankh curates a
          versatile collection of T-shirts, hoodies, and shirts that blend
          modern cuts with lasting comfort. Whether you're dressing for a casual
          day out or making a subtle statement, our pieces are designed to move
          with you — effortlessly.
        </p>

        <p className="fs-5">
          Every thread we use, every design we create, echoes our commitment to
          quality, confidence, and individuality. Our clothes are crafted for
          the man who values both substance and style.
        </p>

        <p className="fs-5">
          Based in India, Morpankh is proud to serve a growing community of
          customers who trust us to deliver not just clothing — but confidence.
        </p>

        <p className="fs-5">
